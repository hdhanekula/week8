# week8

In this assignment, I analyzed sentiment in social media posts collected last week. Then we begin by extracting sentiment scores from the post titles , such as keyword-based scoring or a Python NLP package. Next, I visualized the distribution of sentiment scores with a histogram and compute key descriptive statistics, including the mean, median, and standard deviation.

To gain further insight, i examined posts with the highest and lowest sentiment scores, identifying patterns in extremely positive or negative content. Finally, I provided an analysis of my findings, reflecting on the sentiment trends and the process. I also propose a potential application of this data, such as identifying trends in public opinion or monitoring brand sentiment.

After extracting sentiment scores from the social media post titles, we can observe a varied distribution of sentiment. The histogram showed that most sentiment scores clustered around neutral values, with fewer posts having extremely positive or negative sentiment.

The descriptive statistics revealed that the mean sentiment score was slightly positive, indicating a general trend toward neutral or mildly optimistic content. The median score closely matched the mean confirming a balanced distribution. The standard deviation showed moderate variation, meaning sentiment scores were spread out but not extreme.

Overall, the findings suggest that social media sentiment fluctuates but tends to remain near neutral. This analysis could be useful for identifying sentiment trends, monitoring public reactions, or detecting shifts in online discussions over time.
